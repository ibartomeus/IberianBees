the peninsula and nearby islands. We have at least one record of 934
species out of the 1041 species known to occurr in the area. Here we

## Who make this posible?

This is a large collaborative effort lead by I. Bartomeus, L.
Carvalheiro and T. Woods, but it would not be possible without the
contribution of thousends of researchers. Those are the main
contributors (this can be prettier and more data is in the pipeline).
