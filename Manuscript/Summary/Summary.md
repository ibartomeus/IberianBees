# Summary of the IberianBees database

The Iberian Bee Database contains **87684 entries** of bee occurrences
over the peninsula and nearby islands. We have at least one record of
**923 species** out of the **1066 species** known to occur in the
Iberian Peninsula.

We retained only valid, updated species names. All records have
accompaining metadata on where and when it was collected, and on who
collected, identified and curated the data.

Here we present a summary of the database:
